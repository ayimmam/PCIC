# PCIC Internal Management System

Web platform for the Peak Craft Informatics Community (800+ students across IS, CS, IT at Hawassa University). Digitizes membership tracking, event attendance, leadership decisions, and disciplinary workflows.

## Monorepo Layout

```
client/   — React 18 (JSX, NOT TypeScript) + Vite + Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
server/   — Node.js + Express.js + Mongoose (ES modules)
```

## Tech Stack (do NOT deviate)

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, JSX (no .tsx/.ts), Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, React Router v6, TanStack React Query v5, react-hook-form + zod, Sonner toasts, Lucide icons
- **Backend:** Express.js, Mongoose ODM, JWT auth (jsonwebtoken + bcryptjs), Multer uploads, Nodemailer emails
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Path alias:** `@/` maps to `client/src/` via jsconfig.json

## Feature Modules (Phase 2 MVP)

| ID | Feature | Frontend Page | Backend Route |
|----|---------|--------------|---------------|
| F-001 | Event Attendance Tracker | `/events` | `/api/events` |
| F-012 | Centralized Decision Repo | `/reports` | `/api/decisions` |
| F-006 | Disciplinary Strike System | `/admin` (strikes tab) | `/api/strikes` |
| F-004 | Accelerated Entry Workflow | `/career` | `/api/candidates` |
| — | Member Management | `/members` | `/api/members` |

## User Roles (enforced by `roleGuard.js` backend + `RoleGate.jsx` frontend)

- `president` — full access, approve/reject candidates
- `pm` — manage members, change statuses, create decisions
- `mc` — change member status, track attendance
- `domain_leader` — create events for their domain
- `member` — view events, check in, view own profile

## Key Conventions

- All files use **ES module** syntax (`import`/`export`, not `require`)
- Frontend components are **functional components** with hooks
- API calls go through `client/src/api/axios.js` (auto-attaches JWT)
- Data fetching uses **React Query hooks** in `client/src/hooks/`
- Backend follows **routes → controllers → models** pattern
- All API routes are prefixed with `/api/`
